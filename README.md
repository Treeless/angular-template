# Base Angular 1.x Application (WIP)

This is a good starting point for an angular application. This is the project structure and tools I like to use when getting started. It consists of some examples for angular controllers, services, factories and filters. It uses gulp for minifying js files as well as compiling SCSS files on the fly.

This project is going to constantly evolve and get better as I figure out better ways to make my own development process easier.

## Guide
* `npm install` (installs node modules)
* `bower install` (installs our main client side libraries)
* `gulp` (launches webserver, compiles css, compiles js into one file)
* `gulp unit` (runs the unit tests using karma with mocha and chai. Watches for changes to files and reruns the tests)
* `gulp e2e` (runs the end to end tests with protractor and phantomJS)

## Todo
* Factory example
* Filter example
* Service example
* CSS for examples
* Code documentation
* Cleanup package.json of unneeded packages
